# Dictionary

## Description

A dictionary associates pairs of data items with one another. The first item in such a pair is called a
key and the second item is called the value. A dictionary stores a collection of these key-value pairs.
Dictionaries allow you to look values up by their key.

Suppose we had a dictionary called friends containing key-value pairs where the keys are people’s names, and the value associated with each key is that person’s email address. We could then find out someone’s email address by querying the dictionary for the value associated with a person’s name. If there is a key-value pair in the dictionary friends whose key is ’John Smith’, the value of friends[’John Smith’] would be the email address of John Smith. The keys of a dictionary must be unique — the same key cannot be associated with more than one value. However, the values need not be unique — different keys can be associated with the same value. Thus, there can only be one ’John Smith’ key in friends, but another friend with the key’Jane Smith’ may have the same e-mail address as John Smith.

## Problem description

Pokemon are fantastic creatures that people can catch and train. Pokemon are classified into different "types", such as grass, fire or electric. In addition, they can be found in various locations all over the world. This program is build to help organize information about where to go catch the different pokemon. This problem is divided into 5 diFFerent "questions", but in the end, all of the questions will be combined to complete the overall program. The first four questions will ask to define a function that will perform a specific task.

## Problem details

The problem is divided into 5 diferent "questions", but in the end, the work from all of the questions will be combined to complete the overall program. The first four questions will each ask to define a function that will perform a specific task. The following is a brief overview of how the next five questions will fit together:
- Part 1: Read data about the pokemon from a text file and organize it as a database.
- Part 2: Build a list of all the unique continents where one can find pokemon.
- Part 3: Build a list of all the pokemon that can be found on a particular continent.
- Part 4: Count how many of each pokemon type occur within a given list of pokemon names.
- Part 5: For each continent, display the pokemon type counts.
