# Dictionary

## Description

A dictionary associates pairs of data items with one another. The first item in such a pair is called a
key and the second item is called the value. A dictionary stores a collection of these key-value pairs.
Dictionaries allow you to look values up by their key.

Suppose we had a dictionary called friends containing key-value pairs where the keys are people’s names, and the value associated with each key is that person’s email address. We could then find out someone’s email address by querying the dictionary for the value associated with a person’s name. If there is a key-value pair in the dictionary friends whose key is ’John Smith’, the value of friends[’John Smith’] would be the email address of John Smith. The keys of a dictionary must be unique — the same key cannot be associated with more than one value. However, the values need not be unique — different keys can be associated with the same value. Thus, there can only be one ’John Smith’ key in friends, but another friend with the key’Jane Smith’ may have the same e-mail address as John Smith.
